    I'm currently a BAC+2 student, in the IUT in Montpellier. I'm studying in a BUT, the Computer Science department of
    my IUT (in the top 10% of the year group according to the results).
    <br>
    Along with my class, I'm specializing in the RACDV course, which involves efficient, portable and optimized software
    design.
    <br>
    The current period in my second year is the search for an internship or work-study program: as I'm particularly
    interested in an internship in a company, I'm open to proposals, particularly in low-level or network development,
    but also in web and database programming.
    <br>
    For the time being, I'm planning to finish this 3-years long BUT, and then go on to either a Master's degree in
    Computer Science, or an engineering school.
